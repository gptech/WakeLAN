Summary:

Wakelan is a program that makes waking up remote clients easier. 

What Does it do?
At its core, wakelan puts information about the computers on a LAN into a SQLite3 DB (i used a CSV file initally) and then grabs the relevant entries when i need to start a computer up. Entries can be manually entered, or they can be imported as the results of various network scans (at the moment, i'm only using nbtscan).
